This is a simple simulator of quantum computer, built on top of Google's Cirq and PySide.
It was intended for my engineering thesis. It focuses on entanglement and showing what's happenning inside.

How to build:
For now I won't really bother with preparing a real package, however you can just:
1. Clone the source code
2. Create new virtual environment
3. Download required packages with pip (requirements.txt)
4. Either run src/main.py or use run.sh
